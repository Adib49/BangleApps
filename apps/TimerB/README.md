# Recorder Plus

This app allows you to record data every few seconds - it can run in the background.

Usually, you'd record GPS (but this is not required). The data can later be exported as CSV, KML, or GPX files via the Download button in the Bangle.js App Store entry for Recorder.

# Instalation

for use of this app please install Screen Plus which is modified for this app. The second app is designed when you want to run as well  as you want to see the actual data so basically you need the screen plus.
